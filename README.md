# PREPARING THE ENVIRONMENT

## STEP 1: Install React Chrome Extension

## STEP 2: Instructions for running the environment

    1. Make sure you have those things installed by typing in your terminal:
        - node (you can get node from here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
        - yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

    2. Install all the dependencies with: `yarn`

    3. Run your project with: `yarn start`

    4. You can view your project under `https://localhost:3000`. Any change you'll do will be automatically updated in the browser.

    We're using react-create-app as a boilerplate here.
