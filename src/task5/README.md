# Windowing technique

Files used to finish the task 5: task5/index.js

## STEP 1: Use react-window

1. Looks like our app looks pretty neatly. But do we need to render all the 250 rows at the start of the app? Here's where react-window will help.

2. Take a look at the example List. Get familiar with documentation (https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window)

3. Take a look at task5. The structure of our App changed - react-window don't work very well with table layout so I changed it to divs.

4. Use react-window for our countries table.

## WAY AHEAD OF THE GROUP?

1. Apart from react-window, use react-visibility-sensor. What are the main differences you notice?
